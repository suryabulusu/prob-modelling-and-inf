The following code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. 

Python 3 is used. 
Numpy and Matplotlib libraries required.

The images are saved in the folder. 
random(k).png -> refers to the figure of 10 random functions when phi_k(x) transformation is used
postpred(k).png -> refers to the figure showing the posterior predictive mean when phi_k(x) transformation is used.
				   the shaded region is the +/- 2*(posterior predictive standard deviation)

To implement the code, open the folder in terminal, and type in jupyter lab. 
The folder is opened in the browser in the jupyter environment. 
Open h1.ipynb and run the code.
