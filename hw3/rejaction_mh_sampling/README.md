The following code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. 

Python 3 is used. 
Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy libraries required.

Part 1 - Rejection Sampling

Code is in rejection.ipynb
Images : {rej1, rej2, rej3, rej4}.png

Part 2 - MH Sampling

Code is in MHsampling.ipynb
Images : MH{No.of samples}si2{variance value}.png
Please note that sigma^2 = 100 case takes a lot of time. You can avoid running it by 
removing 100 from Si2 list. (ie, Si2 = [0.01, 1])
