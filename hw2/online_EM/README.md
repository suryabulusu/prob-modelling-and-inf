The following code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. 

Python 3 is used. 
Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy libraries required.

The images of class means can be found in the following folders

K{x}full -> Contains images when K = x is used in Vanilla EM
			Kfull{x}{i}.png for i = 0 to x-1 -> the mean image of i^th class
			
KO_{x} -> Contains images when K = x is used in Online EM
		  KO_{x}{i}.png for i = 0 to x - 1 -> the mean image of i^th class

To implement the code, open the folder in terminal, and type in jupyter lab. 
The folder is opened in the browser in the jupyter environment. 
Open final_solution.ipynb and run the code. 

The dataset should be in the same folder as that of the code

The class means are displayed in the Jupyter notebook itself. 
You can set the variables K, n, T (no. of iterations) in the code (written in comments)
